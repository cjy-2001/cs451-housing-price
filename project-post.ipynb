    "\n",
    "This project aims to use machine learning techniques to analyze and predict housing prices across different counties in the United States, with a focus on understanding the similarities and differences in housing factors between different counties. Instead of using existing dataset, we have identified many relevant datasets and successfully merged them into one. We have built several models, including both classical models and Neural Networks (through Pytorch), and found that the Random Forest model tends to have the highest accuracy. Those models helped us to identify some common factors such as median income, longitude, and education attainment that affect housing prices the most.\n",

    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Housing prices are a crucial aspect of the economy, directly influencing various sectors, including the real estate industry, financial markets, and consumers' purchasing power. Understanding the determinants of housing prices is therefore essential for potential house buyers, sellers, renters, and city planners. Given that reason, this project aims to analyze the relationship between housing prices, demographic, and socioeconomic factors across counties. Therefore, we believe our project can inform and empower various sectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "@ho2021predicting studied property price prediction using three machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) Their study found RF and GBM to provide superior performance over SVM. In our work, we also incorporate Random Forest models due to their demonstrated efficacy and robustness. Similarly, @thamarai2020house highlighted the importance of utilizing different house attributes for price prediction, such as the number of bedrooms, age of the house, and proximity to essential facilities like schools and shopping malls. We too consider a multitude of housing factors and additional socioeconomic features in our analysis. In the meantime, @zulkifley2020house emphasized the importance of data mining in predicting housing prices and highlighted that locational and structural attributes significantly influence predictions We have included a comprehensive set of features in our models, including geospatial information, in line with their recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our analysis, we aim to contribute to this growing body of research, providing further insights into housing price prediction and its influencing factors."

    "## **Value Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potentially benefit**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potential home-buyers and renters can make informed decisions when purchasing properties\n",
    "- Real estate professionals can provide better guidance to their clients\n",
    "- Urban planners and policymakers can make more informed decisions regarding zoning, land use, and housing policies\n",
    "- Social workers can identify drivers of inequality in housing and rent prices and prioritize advocating for change in these key areas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potentially excluded from benefit or harmed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Marginalized populations may be under or misrepresented in the data, so our model may not accurately reflect their needs and wants\n",
    "- Inaccurate predictions leading to incorrect conclusions about a region and/or suboptimal buying/renting decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal Reasons**:\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose this project because I believe a healthy house market is essential for the growth of an economy. It is relevant to everyone, so I'm interested in exploring those possible factors that might contribute to the housing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are confident that the world will be a more equitable and sustainable place under the assumption that our data sources represent different demographics and regions fairly, and the world is a better place when housing prices are low and equitable across demographics."

    "### **Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main data resources: Zillow nad US census. We also collected other explanatory predictors such as land area and geospatial information (longitude & latitude) from other sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The US census data is from the 2017-2021 ACS 5-Year PUMS (American Community Survey, Public Use Microdata Sample), through the Census API: [PUMS Documentation](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata/documentation.html). The dataset contains information from the Census Bureau about individual people or housing units. We believe it is a representative and authoritative source of information for various demographic and economic factors that can influence housing prices and affordability. \n",
    "\n",
    "*You might need a [Census API key](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/guidance/api-user-guide/help.html).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Zillow Housing Data is a collection of datasets from Zillow, a real-estate marketplace company. It contains features include housing prices, rental prices, city, state, number of bedrooms, etc: [ZHVI All Homes (SFR, Condo/Co-op) Time Series, Smoothed, Seasonally Adjusted($), by County](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we collected the geospatial data (centroids of every US county) from <Census.gov>: [U.S. Gazetteer Files 2022](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-geodatabases.html).\n",
    "\n",

    "- `B25001_001E`: total housing units\n",
    "- `B25002_002E`: occupancy is \"occupied\"\n",
    "- `B25018_001E`: median number of rooms\n",
    "- `B25035_001E`: median year of construction\n",

    "## **Results**\n",

    "In order to evaluate those algorithms we used, we implemented two metrics to measure the relative performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Coefficient of Determination](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) (we simply called it \"score\"): it combines the residual sum of squares and the total sum of squares; the best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse).\n",
    "2. Mean Squared Error (MSE): it represents the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. In other words, it quantifies the difference between the estimator (the model's prediction) and the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our random forest model achieved a score of 0.9109, while having a MSE of 1.60781e+09.\n",

    "\n",
    "We usually meet and work together at every week. Bell was mainly responsible for data preprocessing and visualization. He wrote scripts to clean and merge the data. He also generated insightful visualizations such as the interactive map. In the meantime, he designed and executed numerous experiments, with a particular focus on model validation and performance assessment. Then he carried out several classical model experiments, particularly related to feature importance. Jiayi primarily focused on neural network's source code. He was mainly coding the core algorithms and performing several experiments related to hyperparameter tuning. He also helped in finding suitable datasets and selecting variables, as well as plotting multicollinear features. Lastly, we worked on the slides and writings together."
