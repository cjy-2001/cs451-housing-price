# 451-proj
CSCI 0451 project


## Abstract

In 3-4 sentences, concisely describe:

- What problem your project addresses.
- The overall approach you will use to solve the problem.
- How you propose to evaluate your success against your stated goals.

## Motivation and Question

Describe your motivation for your project idea. Some (shortened) examples of good types of motivations:

We have a scientific data set for which predictive or expoloratory models would help us generate hypotheses.
We have user information for which predictive models would help us give users better experiences.
We have performance data (e.g. from sports teams) for which predictive models could help us make better decisions.
Algorithmic bias is an increasingly urgent challenge as machine learning products proliferate, and we want to explore it more deeply.
You should be more specific than these: describe your specific data set (if applicable); your scientific questions; the type of decisions your model could inform; etc.
